                <li>
                    This was a Python Project for my Widening Horizons Module Data Science For Everyone.  Found that there was some link between the two but was very small.

    <h2> Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/low101043/aiProjectComputer"><li>AI algorithms project</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a Java Project which implements differnt AI algorithms I have learnt in my first year Artificial Intelligence module.  This also uses ideas learnt from for other first year modules like Programming in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms.  
                </li>
            </ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/low101043/RSA-Cipher"><li>RSA Cipher</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This implements the RSA Cipher in Python. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Other Ciphers</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As someone who has a lot of interest in Ciphers I have implemented differnt cipher and also differnt ways to break cipher. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Hackathons and CTFs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS Qiskit Hackathon November 2019</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Created a Python program which accurately measures the Pi.  This is done by working the proportion of random coordinates are in or out of the circle.  The random numbers were generated using a (simulated) quantum computer.
                </li>
            </ul>
