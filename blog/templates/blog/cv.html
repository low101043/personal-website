    <ul>
        <a href='https://github.com/low101043/final-year-13-project'><li>Physics Based Shooting 2D Game</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a game created for my project in Year 13.  
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Data Science Group Project investigating the relation between Happiness and Terrorist Attacks</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This was a Python Project for my Widening Horizons Module Data Science For Everyone.  Found that there was some link between the two but was very small.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Personal Website</li>

    <h2> Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/low101043/aiProjectComputer"><li>AI algorithms project</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a Java Project which implements differnt AI algorithms I have learnt in my first year Artificial Intelligence module.  This also uses ideas learnt from for other first year modules like Programming in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms.  
                </li>
            </ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/low101043/GaussianElimination"><li>Gaussian Elimination</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a Java Project which implements Gaussian Elimination which I learnt in my first year module Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/low101043/RSA-Cipher"><li>RSA Cipher</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This implements the RSA Cipher in Python. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Other Ciphers</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As someone who has a lot of interest in Ciphers I have implemented differnt cipher and also differnt ways to break cipher. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Hackathons and CTFs and Competitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS Qiskit Hackathon November 2019</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Created a Python program which accurately measures the Pi.  This is done by working the proportion of random coordinates are in or out of the circle.  The random numbers were generated using a (simulated) quantum computer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <a href ="https://tryhackme.com/hackback2"><li>HackBack 2 October 2019</li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A CTF which was run by TryHackMe.  First ever CTF which I had done.  
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>BAE Systems Capture The Flag January 2020</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A CTF run by BAE. Gave me more experience on how they working</li>
            </ul>
        <li>MLH Local Hack Day</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A day where I learnt a bit about website design and how the cloud works.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>GSA-Ultra</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This was a Programming Competition Over 10 days around August 2020.  I came 168th (out of 968) with 60 points.  As this was my first time ever doing something like this and I restarted my summer job in the middle I was quite happy with the result.
